CS2 cheat
<!--Has anyone found a way to view previous matches in CS2 successfully? With CS:GO there was a tab on Steam under 'My Game Stats' you could go to to view your Competitive Match history (and scoreboard details) for all matches back several years, but I just played my first CS2 matches and can't seem to find that.

I like to track my progress over time using this data, so would love to get it for CS2! Any ideas -->
